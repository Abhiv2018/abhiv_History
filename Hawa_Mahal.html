Hawa Mahal
</h1><br>
Designed by Lal Chand Ustad, Hawa Mahal is built in red and pink sandstone. Interestingly, Hawa Mahal is more of a gallery and was created so that the royal ladies could look outside as they were constantly under ‘purdah’.<br>

Located in the heart of Jaipur, Hawa Mahal can be reached via bus, auto-rickshaw, taxi or cars from the capital city. The months of September to February are the best time to visit Hawa Mahal.<br>
