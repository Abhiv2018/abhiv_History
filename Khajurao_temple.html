Khajurao Temple
</h1><br>
Located in the small town of Khajuraho, the Khajuraho Temples have found a place within UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites and are visited annually by many visitors.<br>

This group of Hindu and Jain temples built by the Chandelas reflects the acceptance and respect for diverse religions during those times. All temples, barring one, are east-facing and glimmer at the break of dawn by the sunrise.<br>

The temples are famous for intricately carved statues and sculptures, some of which are remnants of the ancient culture of Kama Sutra.<br>

Visit these temples to delve deeper into the traditional Hindu values of Dharma, Kama, Artha, and Moksha, that these temples are symbolic of.<br>
