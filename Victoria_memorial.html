Victoria Memorial
</h1><br>
Located right in the heart of Kolkata, this memorial has been named after Queen Victoria. The elegant white marble structure is girdled by lush green gardens which together cover 64 acres of land.<br>

Small sculptures and statues, which are spread throughout the gardens, add further charm to the memorial premises.<br>

The memorial is illuminated by lights in the evening and runs high in terms of seraphic beauty.<br>

Don’t miss out on the evening show called ‘Son et Lumiere’ on your visit.<br>
