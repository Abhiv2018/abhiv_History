<h1>
Sanchi Stupa
</h1><br>
The Sanchi stupa stands as an unparalleled example of the majestic aura that is encompassed within the Buddhist style of architecture. Ancient relics of Lord Buddha are rooted within the dome- shaped structure of the stupa, which was how the structure looked until the dawn of the 1st century.<br>
<br>
The stupa borrows its esteem from its commissioner, Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty, whose stature can be well indicated in the terms of the stupa’s altitude. The 54 ft. high stupa tells the tales of Lord Buddha’s life through its mesmerizing carvings, whose intricacy personifies the architecture.<br>
<br>
Marked as a UNESCO world heritage site the stupa is visited regularly by uncountable visitors.<br>
